    <li><h2>Student Mentoring</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As a first-year Sixth Form student, I worked as part of a group of students led by our school mentor to help provide academic and emotional support to Year 7 to 11 students. I did this by communicating with my allocated students through email and in person weekly, addressing any concerns or issues they may have had.</li>
        <li>I was able to develop teamwork and communication skills through producing podcasts with my fellow school mentors tackling problems such as toxic masculinity and maintaining a healthy school-life balance.</li>

                <li>I competed in trials and was subsequently selected to play age-group Representative Cricket for the county of Buckinghamshire. I was chosen to open the bowling and I had the opportunity to go on tour in Yorkshire with the team.</li>
